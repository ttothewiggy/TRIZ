- **Introduction to Design Thinking**:
    - **Design thinking** is a popular approach with over 600 book titles on the subject. At its core, design thinking is about navigating **complex environments**, particularly when dealing with **people**.
    - Itâ€™s an iterative process that involves **empathy with the customer**, **quick experimentation**, and **learning** from each attempt to move toward a better solution.

- **Divergent and Convergent Cycles**:    
    - Design thinking consists of two main **cycles**:
        - **Divergence**: The exploratory phase where you consider a wide range of possibilities and ideas.
        - **Convergence**: The decision-making phase where you narrow down and focus on the most promising options.
    - These cycles are repeated in two key areas of the innovation process: **problem definition** and **solution generation**.
    
- **Cycle 1: Problem Definition**:    
    - The first cycle begins with **divergence**, exploring all the potential problems and opportunities, as seen with tools like the **functional model** from earlier in the module.
    - The **convergent phase** then focuses on deciding which problem or **insufficient function** will be the primary focus for improvement.
    
- **Cycle 2: Solution Generation**:    
    - After defining the problem, the process moves into the **solution generation** phase, which also starts with divergence. This is where you **generate a wide range of ideas** to solve the problem.
    - After exploring enough ideas (or as the speaker says, "diverge until it hurts"), the **convergent phase** begins, where the most promising ideas are selected, refined, or combined into a potential solution.

- **Iterative Process**:    
    - The design thinking process is **iterative**, meaning you may return to the beginning of the cycle multiple times, refining your approach based on what you learn from each round of testing and feedback.
