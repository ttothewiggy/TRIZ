**Function, Job, or Outcome**:

- Whether you call it **function**, **job**, or **outcome**, the idea is the same: customers are trying to **achieve something**. Different authors and methodologies may use different terms, but they all point to the **end goal** that customers are trying to reach.
- Innovators must focus on understanding **what the customer wants to achieve**, as this serves as the foundation for successful innovation.

**Multiple Customers**:

- In some industries, like healthcare, there are **multiple customers** (e.g., patients, clinicians, staff), and each has their own desired outcomes. Innovators need to account for all these different perspectives and functions when developing solutions.

**Bedrock of Innovation**:
-  Understanding the customerâ€™s desired **function** or **outcome** is the **bedrock** of the innovation process. Everything else in the innovation story must be built on this understanding.

**Breaking Down Existing Systems**:

- By understanding the functions customers are trying to achieve, innovators can better **break down existing systems**, identify **problems**, and discover opportunities to **improve** and **innovate**. 

**Next Steps**:

- The upcoming videos will focus on how to use this understanding of **function** to find opportunities for innovation and remove problems in existing systems.

### Conclusion
Understanding the **function** or **outcome** customers are trying to achieve is critical for successful innovation. It serves as the foundation for identifying improvements, solving problems, and creating valuable solutions. This understanding will guide the next steps in the innovation process.
