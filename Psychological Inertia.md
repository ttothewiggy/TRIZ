What is Psychological Inertia?

If we know where we are on the S-Curve, we know what jobs we need to do on the system. 
Identifying where a product is on the S-curve helps predict what is likely to happen next and what type of innovation or improvements are needed.
Toothbrush example. 


Stages of the S-Curve
Beginning - Just simply make it work. Curve is quite flat at this stage.
Improvement - Now make it work properly.
Performance - Measurement in the system. Teeth clean feel. Whiter?
Efficiency - Getting most out of system. Cost Focus stage. Maximise value for consumer. 
Reliability - Fine-tuning, increase durability, reduce costs. Final optimization stage. 
Cost Dominance - Maximum potential reached, market becomes saturated and price becomes the key differentiator.

### Conclusion:

Understanding the S-curve and accurately assessing where a product stands on it is crucial for innovation strategy. It helps businesses anticipate market needs, plan for future development, and recognize when a new approach is necessary to avoid stagnation. In the example of toothbrushes, different types (manual vs. electric) are at various stages of their S-curves, which guides their respective innovation and market strategies.
