Labelling the Titanic as "The Unsinkable Ship" created a sense of **psychological inertia**, which contributed to the tragic loss of life. This false belief led passengers and crew to underestimate the danger, rely too heavily on the ship's supposed invincibility, and fail to prepare adequately for a disaster. As a result, they were slower to react and less likely to question assumptions about safety, ultimately contributing to the high death toll.

**Psychological Inertia**: People tend to rely on familiar patterns and established rules, which can hinder creative thinking and innovation. On the Titanic, this inertia led to following conventional safety protocols without considering whether they were appropriate for the specific situation.

**Operational Excellence Mindset**: The passengers and crew followed traditional protocols like using lifeboats and life vests. However, this mindset did not account for the freezing water of the North Atlantic, where being in the water—even with a life vest—would quickly lead to hypothermia and death.

**Challenging Assumptions**: The key assumption that lifeboats and life vests were the best survival tools needed to be questioned. Instead, the focus should have been on **keeping people out of the water** to ensure survival. By reframing the problem, alternative solutions become possible.

**Alternative Solutions**: The Titanic was full of wooden materials (chairs, tables, floorboards) that float. By breaking apart and lashing these materials together, makeshift rafts could have been created to keep more people dry and out of the water until rescue arrived.

**Lesson for Innovators**: The story highlights the danger of sticking to conventional thinking in crisis situations. Innovators need to challenge assumptions and think outside the box, using available resources creatively to solve problems.
