The **Nine Windows** tool is designed to help break out of the typical mindset (the middle "Present-System" box) and explore other possibilities. It encourages looking for resources and ideas from different angles (past, future, outside, or inside the system).

**Application to the Titanic**:

- **Super System**: By looking outside the system (the Titanic), the iceberg, which was initially a problem, could be repurposed as a resource to keep people out of the water.
- **Sub System**: Inside the ship, materials like wood, blankets, or other items could have been used to create makeshift rafts or patch holes.
- **Time**: Time plays a crucial role. For example, in the future (next two hours), the ship’s structure would change. Closing certain compartments initially was a good idea to keep water out, but later, it would have been better to open the doors to slow the ship’s sinking and buy more time for rescue.

#### Key Insight
The human brain tends to stay in the "Present-System" box, focusing on immediate, familiar solutions. If you're stuck on a problem for too long, it indicates the need to explore one of the other eight boxes to find fresh perspectives or untapped resources.


##### The **Nine Windows** tool can be adapted to solve problems by focusing on critical moments and system components. Here is a 6 window version.

1. **Focus on Problem-Solving**:
    - When facing a problem, the goal is to resolve it quickly, not necessarily to innovate, but to get things back to normal.
      
2. **Six Windows, Not Nine**:    
    - The focus is reduced to two **time slices**:
        - The moment the problem occurred.
        - The moment **just before** the problem occurred.
    - By comparing these moments, you can identify what has changed, which may help solve the issue.
      
3. **Subsystem, System, Super System**:
    - You still examine:
        - **Subsystem**: Components inside the system.
        - **System**: The whole system.
        - **Super System**: External factors outside the system that may have influenced the problem.
          
4. **Super System Example**:
    - A photographic film company experienced issues due to vibrations only on certain days. They eventually discovered the vibrations were caused by low-flying planes during specific weather conditions—an external factor (super system).
      
5. **Key Takeaway**:    
    - The tool helps identify what has changed in the system and reveals external influences, allowing for a quick solution to problems by breaking assumptions and examining all possible factors.

This adapted tool helps narrow the focus in problem situations to find fast, effective solutions.
