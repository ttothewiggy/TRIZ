### Innovation Direction

How the successful innovators (2%)differ from those who fail (98%). 

It centres around the idea of providing **more value to customers** and follows the value equation. 
#### Value Equation

Value =  Benefits​/Cost + Harm

- To succeed, innovators must deliver more benefits while reducing costs and harm.

- The perception of value is crucial; if a customer perceives something as better, it is better in their eyes.

#### North Star for Innovation

- The North Star of innovation is the ultimate goal for providing all the benefits the customer wants while eliminating the cost and harm. 
- The ideal star is the **Ideal Final Result (IFR)** or the concept of **"Free, Perfect and Now"**
	- **Free**: No cost to the customer.
	- **Perfect**: No harm or downsides.
	- **Now**: Instantaneous results.
eg Google

**Challenges of Free, Perfect, and Now**:

- Most companies focus on **perfect** and **now** (operational excellence), but **free** is the difficult part.
- However, **successful innovators** embrace all three elements, as exemplified by companies like **Google**, which provides free services while still being highly profitable.

**Contradictions in Innovation**:

- Innovators face contradictions like wanting to **deliver faster and better** while still **making money**, and customers wanting things for free.
- The process of solving these contradictions is what drives successful innovation, and many contradictions have already been solved in various ways.



The progression toward **Free, Perfect, and Now** is inevitable. The key uncertainty is **how quickly** it will happen, but innovators should view this as an opportunity rather than a threat.
