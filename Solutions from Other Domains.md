**Function** can include not only tangible functions but also **emotional needs** and requirements, a concept popularized by companies like **Apple**.

- **New Class of Functions: Emotional Needs**:
    - While previous discussions focused on **tangible functions** (e.g., product features), this new dimension introduces **emotional functions**, which focus on fulfilling the **emotional needs** of customers.
    - These emotional functions are more challenging to measure and assess, but they play a crucial role in innovation, especially in industries like technology.
    
- **Four-Quadrant Model**:
    - A **simple template** divides customer needs into four quadrants based on two dimensions:
        - **Tangible vs. Intangible**: Tangible needs are measurable and easy to define (e.g., performance specs), while intangible needs are emotional and harder to quantify.
        - **Me vs. We**: The **Me** refers to the individual customer (e.g., the person using a product), while the **We** refers to the social group around them (e.g., people they communicate with, influence, or share experiences with).
        
- **Understanding Both Individual and Group Needs**:
    - It’s essential to consider both the individual’s and the group's needs because what an individual desires may not fully align with the group’s expectations or requirements. Successful innovation accounts for both perspectives.
    
- **Apple’s Success with Emotional Intangibles**:
    - Apple is highlighted as a company that has succeeded by tapping into **intangible, emotional needs** without relying heavily on traditional market research.
    - **Three core emotional drivers**—referred to as **A, B, C**—drive customer behavior:
        - **A = Autonomy**: People want to feel they are in control of their choices and experiences.
        - **B = Belonging**: People desire to feel part of a community or a group (e.g., the aspirational Apple brand).
        - **C = Competence**: People want to feel capable and skilled. Apple products are designed to be intuitive, making users feel competent from the moment they start using them, eliminating the need for user guides.

- **Key to Innovation Success**:
    - Innovators must improve **Autonomy**, **Belonging**, and **Competence** in their products. Successful products cater not only to **functional needs** but also to these **core emotional drivers**, making them more compelling and desirable to customers.
