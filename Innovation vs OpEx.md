Poorly defined problems lead to failure. Learn how to identify the real problem.

Operation Excellence World = everyday world where people are comfortable. It's focussed on efficiency, consistency and control. 

Innovation World = Fundamentally different to OpEx. It's about finding new ways, challenging existing assumptions and rules. 

**Bridging the gap

The gap between these two worlds represents a shift from one curve to another

Individuals who can navigate both worlds, often referred to as the "1%," are especially valuable.

**Law of Diminishing Returns and Contradictions**:

When improving a system, there is often a point where further efforts yield smaller and smaller improvements. This is known as the law of diminishing returns.

**Fluid-Filled Bag Metaphor**:

The "fluid-filled bag" is a metaphor for a system where different variables and outputs are interrelated. Imagine the bag containing all the elements we want to achieve from a system (like speed, quality, cost, etc.).

When you squeeze the bag in one place (trying to improve one variable, like speed), it bulges somewhere else (something else gets worse, like quality). This illustrates how optimizing one aspect can cause problems in another.

**Innovation as Changing the Fluid in the Bag**:

Innovation is described as finding ways to "change the amount of fluid in the bag." This means altering the system so that improvements in one area do not cause declines in others.

A good starting point for innovation is asking **"Wouldn't it be great if...?"**

**Jumping to a New Curve**:

Over time, as more contradictions are resolved and innovations are implemented, the system can "jump to another curve," representing a new level of performance or a new way of operating.

#### **Key Takeaway**:

The main idea is that while operational excellence focuses on optimizing within a set framework and dealing with trade-offs, innovation seeks to break free from those constraints by finding entirely new solutions that overcome inherent contradictions.
