#### The Word "Self" in Innovation
Many ideal solutions across industries incorporate the word **"self"**, meaning systems that manage or improve themselves without requiring user intervention. This concept is central to creating products or services that provide all the benefits with none of the costs or harm.

**Examples from Different Industries**:

- **Software and Communications**: In these fast-evolving industries, systems that update and manage themselves (like self-updating software or self-managing operating systems) provide maximum value to customers by eliminating the need for manual intervention.
- **Physical Products**: While innovation may be slower in physical products, the "self" concept still applies. For example:
    - **Self-cleaning glass** reduces maintenance.
    - **Self-balancing engines** solve design challenges by eliminating the need for constant manual adjustments.
- **Medical Devices**: The use of **self-expanding stents** in medical procedures is an example where the product adapts itself to the patient's needs, simplifying the process for clinicians.

- **Applying "Self" to Innovation**:
    
    - Incorporating **self-sustaining features** into designs allows for less maintenance, better efficiency, and increased customer satisfaction. By thinking in terms of how a product can "do it itself" (clean, balance, update, etc.), innovators can move closer to the ideal solution.
- **Patent Databases as a Resource**:
    
    - Searching for patents using the keyword **"self"** can quickly reveal existing solutions in various industries. Innovators can find inspiration or see how others have solved similar problems by focusing on self-managing or self-sustaining solutions.
