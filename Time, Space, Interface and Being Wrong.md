**Innovation as a Maze**:

- The metaphor used is of a **mouse** (the innovator) trying to navigate a maze to reach the **cheese** (the ideal solution or North Star, which represents "Free, Perfect, and Now").
- In the **maze**, the mouse faces walls (contradictions) that block its path to the ideal solution.

**Operational Excellence vs. Innovation**:

- **Operational excellence** is about weaving through the maze, making gradual progress.
- **Innovation**, on the other hand, is about identifying the **contradictions** (walls) that block the path and **knocking them down** to find a faster, more direct route to the North Star.


**Solving Contradictions**:

- Each **contradiction** is a barrier to progress, and the innovator's job is to systematically knock down these walls.
- By understanding the **North Star**, innovators know which contradictions to prioritize and focus on, helping them move faster toward the ideal solution.

**Leadership Insight**:

- Leaders donâ€™t need to solve every contradiction at once. Instead, the goal is to stay **one contradiction ahead** of the competition. Continuous progress by resolving one more contradiction than competitors is the key to success.
- This approach keeps organizations on track, moving closer to the 2% of successful innovators rather than the 98% who fail.
