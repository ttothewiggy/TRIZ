1. **System Attributes**:
    - The template starts by listing the **attributes** of the system. Using a toothbrush as an example, attributes might include **bristle stiffness**, **size**, or **flexibility**. These are elements the designer controls before delivering the product to the customer.
    
1. **Contradictions Between Customers**:
    - The template considers two extreme customers (**Customer A** and **Customer B**), representing opposite ends of the customer spectrum.
    - For instance, a small child may need a **small toothbrush**, while an adult may need a **larger toothbrush**. Designing a toothbrush for the average size would satisfy neither, revealing a **contradiction**.
    - It also introduces the idea that the toothbrushâ€™s **ideal size** when not in use could be **zero**, pushing designers to think about extreme ideal scenarios.
    
1. **Manufacturer Perspective**:
    - The template also looks at contradictions between **customer needs** and what the **manufacturer** desires. For instance, while customers may want varying sizes, manufacturers may prefer **standardization** for efficiency, revealing another contradiction and an innovation opportunity.
    
1. **Attribute Conflicts**:
    - The template explores **attribute conflicts**, where improving one attribute worsens another. For example, **stiff bristles** clean teeth faster, but **soft bristles** are gentler on gums. This creates a trade-off between cleaning time and comfort, presenting another contradiction to solve.
    
1. **Goal of the Template**:
    - The purpose of the template is to identify as many **contradictions** as possible, whether they arise between different customers, between customer and manufacturer needs, or between competing product attributes.
    - By recognizing these contradictions, designers and innovators can explore opportunities for **innovation** and develop solutions that address these conflicting demands.

### Conclusion:

The template helps innovators systematically identify contradictions between system attributes, customer needs, manufacturer desires, and conflicting product features. Solving these contradictions opens up new opportunities for innovation, allowing for progress toward the **ideal solution**.
