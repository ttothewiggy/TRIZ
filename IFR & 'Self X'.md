There needs to be a focus on making the concept of **ideal solutions** more practical and applicable in everyday innovation work.

#### The ultimate ideal
The idea of **ideal solutions** (ultimate, perfect solutions) can be overwhelming or unrealistic in some contexts. However, it remains useful as a **directional guide** to ensure that innovations are heading towards delivering more benefits with less cost and harm.

**Convergence in Innovation**:
- As innovations move toward ideal solutions, **industries converge**, with many different fields heading towards similar outcomes for customers. This convergence happens because the closer we get to solving fundamental customer needs, the fewer solutions there are to meet those needs.

**Two Steps in the Template**:
    
 **Ultimate Ideal**: This section asks innovators to define the ultimate, ideal solution in their field. For example:
    - **Teeth clean themselves**.
    - **The patient heals themselves**. The word **"self"** often appears in ideal solutions, reflecting systems that solve problems automatically.
**Project-specific Ideal**: This section brings the ideal closer to today's reality. It encourages innovators to think about the ideal solution for the **specific project** they're working on, balancing immediate goals with the long-term ideal. It asks, "What would be the best solution for this current project, keeping benefits, costs, and harm in mind?"

**Pragmatic North Star**:

The **project-specific ideal** serves as a **pragmatic North Star**, a more reachable version of the ultimate ideal, helping teams to focus on immediate, realistic improvements while still aligning with the long-term direction.
