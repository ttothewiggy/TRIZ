#### Problems = Resources

**Seeing Problems as Resources**:

The core idea is that even the "bad stuff" (challenges or problems) in a system can be reframed as valuable resources. This mindset is crucial for fostering innovative breakthroughs.


**Applying to the Titanic**:

- **The Iceberg**: Initially seen as the cause of the disaster, the iceberg could have been used as a resource. For example, passengers could have been ferried onto the iceberg to keep them out of the freezing water, a much better alternative for survival.
- **Water Inflow**: Instead of simply blocking the holes inside the ship, the water flowing into the Titanic could have been used as a resource. By throwing flexible materials like blankets or tarps overboard, the waterâ€™s flow would have pulled these items into the hole, progressively blocking it.
