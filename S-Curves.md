#### The Myth of Continuous Improvement

CI can be perceived as a steady, ongoing process.
In reality it's a non-linear path characterized by cycles of improvement, stagnation and necessary leaps to new methods and systems. 

**Key Ideas:**

- **Non-Linear Improvement:** Initial efforts in any improvement lead to noticeable gains, but eventually, progress slows down due to the law of diminishing returns.
- **The Plateau:** As efforts to improve continue, they eventually hit a plateau where further improvements become increasingly difficult or impossible.
- **Discontinuous Jumps:** To break out of the plateau, a significant change or innovation (a discontinuous jump) is required. This involves adopting new methods or systems.
- **Innovation Cycle:** After the jump, another cycle of improvement begins, leading again to a plateau, necessitating further jumps. This cycle of improvement and innovation repeats.
- **Real-World Examples:** This pattern can be observed in various domains, such as sports (e.g., Dick Fosburyâ€™s innovation in high jumping), manufacturing, and even natural systems.

**Conclusion:** True progress is not continuous but involves alternating phases of improvement and innovation, with each jump to a new method or system resetting the cycle.
