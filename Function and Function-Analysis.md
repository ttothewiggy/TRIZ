A functional analysis model (FOX) is used to help map negative aspects of a system. 
Crucial for uncovering opportunities for improvement and innovation. 

**Four Types of Negative Aspects** (toothbrush example):

- **Harmful functions**: Components or interactions that cause harm. For example, bristles may clean teeth but also **damage gums**, which is harmful.
  
- **Useful but insufficient**: Functions that are useful but don't happen **enough**. For example, bristles clean teeth, but perhaps they don't **clean thoroughly** enough.
  
- **Useful but excessive**: Functions that are useful but happen **too much**. For instance, if the bristles clean too aggressively, they may over-clean and cause discomfort.
  
- **Missing functions**: Functions that should be there but are **absent**. For example, the addition of a **tongue scraper** on the back of a toothbrush is an innovation that addressed a missing function.

- **Harmful functions** are marked with a **red pen** or a **wavy line**.
- **Insufficient functions** are shown with a **dotted line**.
- **Excessive functions** use a **double-thickness line**.
- **Missing functions** are represented with **no line** or a **dotted line** without an arrow.
