The story of Dick Fosbury is used here to illustrate the challenges and dynamics of innovation, highlighting why it can be difficult and how it fundamentally differs from the operational excellence mindset.
He wasn't the best jumper, but he was determined. 
He didn't actually break any records but he paved the way for more talented jumpers to break records. 
It was his challenge over **conventional thinking** that prevailed. 
His approach faced scepticism, know as the "yes, but" moments where new ideas are often met with objections like "Yes, but it will cost too much," "Yes, but it will take too long," or "Yes, but we don't have the equipment."

His perseverance and continued refinement caused him to win gold in the Olympics. 

The story of Dick Fosbury highlights key characteristics of innovation: the need for perseverance, the willingness to challenge conventional thinking, and the ability to continue despite initial failures and scepticism.

Innovation is difficult because it often involves venturing into unknown territory, facing resistance, and working through counterintuitive ideas. However, those who persist and refine their ideas can achieve significant breakthroughs, fundamentally changing the way things are done.
