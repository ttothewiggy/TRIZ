There's a flat period of the curve when you're trying to figure out the best way of doing things.

For example, Alexander graham Bells telephone struggled to gain traction due to high costs and limited adoption. 
Laying expensive copper wire hundreds of kms for 1 person to use.
But eventually it gained enough adoption that it reached it's tipping point and powered through. 

We suddenly accelerate when we pass the tipping point. When we figure out/invent a new manufacturing process/demand rises /economy of scale to make innovation more economical. 

Steep part of the curve is where customers recognise it's benefit, sales teams can sell it and the money is made. 

At the top of the S-curve, organizations often face contradictions that prevent further improvement.
For instance, the challenge of laying copper wires for landline telephones eventually led to the innovation of cellular phones, representing a jump to a new curve.

Although new innovations initially start below the previous curve, they eventually surpass the older technology as they improve.

CI within a plateaued curve is futile, real progress is a shift to a new paradigm.
