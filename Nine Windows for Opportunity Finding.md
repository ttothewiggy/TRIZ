Unlike the previous problem-solving scenario, this version of the tool expands the time dimension to take a **long-term view** of situations. This is useful for innovation, where you're looking to understand the full scope of a customer’s interaction with products and services over time.

**Broader Time Dimension**:
    - Unlike the previous problem-solving scenario, this version of the tool expands the time dimension to take a **long-term view** of situations. This is useful for innovation, where you're looking to understand the full scope of a customer’s interaction with products and services over time.
    
**Moments of Truth**:
    - The tool helps identify **critical moments** when customers engage with a product or service. In some industries, like fast-moving consumer goods, there are fewer moments (e.g., choosing a product on a shelf, using it at home). In more complex industries, like medical devices, there are many moments involving different stakeholders (clinicians, nurses, patients), offering multiple opportunities to innovate.
    
**Challenging Assumptions and Finding Resources**:
    - The tool is used to **challenge assumptions** at each time stage and find **resources** (even potential problems that can be turned into solutions) to help improve the customer experience and drive innovation.
      
**Perseverance in Innovation**:
    - Innovation requires **perseverance**, and the process of going through all these different windows is often tedious but necessary. The 2% of successful innovators stick with it, discovering new insights and opportunities to engage with customers in better ways.
      
**Subsystem, System, Super System**:
    - The vertical axis (subsystem, system, super system) remains important, allowing innovators to explore opportunities at different levels of the system and beyond.


### Conclusion:

The expanded **Nine Windows** tool is about taking a **holistic view** of a system over time, particularly to understand customer behavior and find innovation opportunities. Success in this process relies heavily on **perseverance** and the ability to challenge assumptions across various stages and dimensions.
