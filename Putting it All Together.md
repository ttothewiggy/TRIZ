### 1. **Function**:

- At the core of innovation is understanding **function**. If we fail to get the function right, everything else falls apart.
- This involves identifying the **needs** of the customer and the **outcome** they want to achieve. It is the foundation on which successful innovation is built.

### 2. **Ideal Solution**:

- Knowing the direction we are heading in is crucial, which is where the concept of the **ideal solution** comes in.
- We’ve discussed the **ideal final result** and the **North Star**—the ultimate goal of innovation where everything works perfectly, costs nothing, and causes no harm.
- The key word here is **self**, meaning the ideal solution should deliver its function **automatically**.

### 3. **Contradictions**:

- Most successful innovations come from solving **contradictions**—trade-offs or paradoxes in the system.
- Innovators must actively seek out contradictions and work to **resolve** them instead of accepting them as unsolvable.
- This is a critical pillar that will be revisited in the next module.

### 4. **Resources**:

- This pillar emphasizes making the most of the **resources** we already have.
- The **Nine Windows tool** was discussed as a way to find hidden resources or overlooked elements within a system.
- Rather than adding complexity by introducing new components, the focus is on maximizing the **efficiency** of the current system. Adding something new should be a **last resort**.

### 5. **Psychological Inertia**:

- The **psychological barriers** that prevent us from thinking creatively are a major challenge in innovation.
- Our brains are wired to stick to familiar patterns, and this inertia can hold back new ideas.
- Innovators must learn to **change perspectives** on problems and think beyond conventional solutions. The **Time Windows tool** is one way to help shift perspectives and break free from this inertia.


### Conclusion:

Successful innovation relies on keeping these **five pillars** in mind as a checklist:

- **Function**: Understand and meet the customer’s needs.
- **Ideal Solution**: Know the ultimate direction (the North Star).
- **Contradictions**: Identify and resolve trade-offs.
- **Resources**: Maximize what’s already available in the system.
- **Psychological Inertia**: Be aware of mental barriers and find ways to break through them.

By applying these pillars, innovators can significantly improve their chances of being in the **2%** of success stories rather than the **98%** who fail.
