**Someone, somewhere has likely already solved your problem**, even if the solution comes from a completely different field. 

- **Problems Arenâ€™t Always Unique**:
    - While it might feel like your problem is unique, many challenges are similar when you break them down to their **basic functions**.
    - By focusing on **function** rather than specifics, you can access solutions from a broader range of industries and applications.
    - 
- **Function as a Knowledge Map**:
    - **Function** serves as a way to **organize knowledge**. Rather than categorizing information alphabetically or by industry, you can categorize it by **function** (what a system is trying to do).
    - This allows you to access solutions from different fields that share the same **functional** challenge.
    - 
- **Example: Moving Liquid**:
    - Using the simple problem of trying to get **water out of a glass** without touching the glass, you can abstract the problem to the function of **moving liquid**.
    - When framed as **moving liquid**, you realize that many industries have solved this problem in various ways (e.g., hydraulics, injection molding, or coffee brewing).
    - By exploring how different industries have addressed **moving liquids**, you can discover over 100 ways to achieve this function, often with solutions that are unfamiliar because they come from unrelated fields.
    - 
- **Accessing the World's Knowledge**:
    - There are **databases** available, such as the one mentioned in the video, that compile solutions across industries based on function. These databases are often free and underutilized, making them valuable resources for innovators looking for fresh ideas.
    - 
- **Cross-industry Innovation**:
    - Companies like **Dyson** have built entire businesses around transferring functions from one industry to another. By applying solutions from one domain to another, they innovate effectively and solve problems in new ways.
