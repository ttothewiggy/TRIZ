**Psychological Inertia**:

- Psychological inertia refers to the tendency of the human brain to rely on established patterns and habits. This is a result of our brain's evolution, where remembering patterns and routines helps save time and increases efficiency in everyday tasks.
- This behaviour is extremely useful in the operational excellence world, where repeating established patterns ensures efficiency and predictability.
 
When it comes to innovation, psychological inertia becomes a barrier. It keeps individuals and organizations stuck in old ways of thinking, making it challenging to come up with new, creative solutions.

To innovate effectively, it's essential to break out of these habitual thought patterns and look at problems from fresh, unfamiliar perspectives.


### Conclusion:

The main takeaway from this section is that innovation requires overcoming psychological inertia, which keeps us stuck in established ways of thinking. By recognizing this tendency and actively seeking to view problems from fresh perspectives, innovators can break free from traditional thought patterns and find new, creative solutions. This process is essential for starting the innovation journey and finding the "right problem" to solve with the "right solution."
